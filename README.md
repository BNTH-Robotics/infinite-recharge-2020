Infinite Recharge
================

2020 Belton Robotics FIRST code for
the robot [insert robot name here].


Controls(DRAFT)
--------
The controller used is the glorious Xbox Controller.

**Motion:**
"Arcade" style control 
with the left joystick.

**Intake:**
1. A to have the intake motors spin in
2. B to out
3. X to stop intake

**Storage:**
Option 1(recommended)
More freedom and control.
1. Left bumper moves Storage up
2. Right bumper moves Storage down

Option 2:
*frees up the driver's hand, less intuitive, less pressing*
1. Back bumper(one of them) toggle up or down

Option 3(NOT RECOMMENDED):
(Intuitive but cumbersome, forces the driving hand
off or to switch to the other joystick.)
1. D-pad up to move the Container up
2. D-pad down to move the Container down


**Hook:**
1. Y to toggle hook in a garage door fashion.
i.e. if the hook is moving, press Y to stop it.
Reasoning: the user will no longer be collecting
balls, and the Y button is in easy reach
for time constrained situations.
